Thanks to @catalinmiron

This is an animated carousel/animated slider with lots of animations going on.

- use the snapToInterval prop
- display a portion from the prev and next item
- align the active slide in the middle
- with MaskedView (IOS only) and without MaskView

Built using @expo, vanilla React Native Animated API and FlatList.
This code works in plain React Native project as well since we are using only React Native APIs such as Animated and FlatList.
