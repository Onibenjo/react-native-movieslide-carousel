Thanks to @catalinmiron

This is an animated carousel/animated slider with lots of animations going on.

- use the snapToInterval prop
- display a portion from the prev and next item
- align the active slide in the middle
- with MaskedView (IOS only) and without MaskView

Built using @expo, vanilla React Native Animated API and FlatList.
This code works in plain React Native project as well since we are using only React Native APIs such as Animated and FlatList.

Create a `config.js` inside `service` folder with

```javascript
export const API_KEY = "TMDB_API_KEY";
```
